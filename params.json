I started a few months ago when I learned that Minecraft could be fiddled with code. I started with some books, then I eventually ended up here after seeing that coding a website could be fun. The book I am using is *_JavaScript For Dummies_* written by Eva Holland.\r\n\r\n### What and where are my projects?\r\nSome of my projects are at [JsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net). I will be uploading most of them (the ones that work!) to this website.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\nFirst of all, I would like to say thanks to my father, mother, and sister; they have supported me a lot in this journey. Gracias also to the following: Eva Holland for writing *_JavaScript For Dummies_* and github.com for enabling me to host a website [@Github website](https://github.com). ##THANK YOU!!!",
